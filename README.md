# Introduction
Stress and time management are two of the most important aspects of our lives. Stress is a fact of life, and it can come from various sources such as work, relationships, and finances. It can have a significant impact on our physical and mental health. On the other hand, time management is the process of organizing and planning how much time you spend on different activities. It is essential to manage time effectively to achieve your goals and reduce stress. In this presentation, we will discuss the importance of stress and time management, how they are related, and some practical tips to manage them effectively.

# Defining Stress
Stress is the way human beings react both physically and mentally to changes, events, and
situations in their lives. People experience stress in different ways and for different reasons.
The reaction is based on your perception of an event or situation. If you view a situation
negatively, you will likely feel distressed—overwhelmed, oppressed, or out of control. Distress
is the more familiar form of stress. The other form, eustress, results from a “positive” view
of an event or situation, which is why it is also called “good stress.”

Eustress helps you rise to a challenge and can be an antidote to boredom because it
engages focused energy. That energy can easily turn to distress, however, if something causes
you to view the situation as unmanageable or out of control. Many people regard public
speaking or airplane flights as very stressful—causing physical reactions such as an increased
heart rate and a loss of appetite—while others look forward to the event. It’s often a question
of perception: A positive stressor for one person can be a negative stressor for another

# Causes of Stress
The most frequent reasons for “stressing out” fall into three main categories:
1. The unsettling effects of change
2. The feeling that an outside force is challenging or threatening you
3. The feeling that you have lost personal control.
4. 
Life events such as marriage, changing jobs, divorce, or the death of a relative or friend
are the most common causes of stress. Although life-threatening events are less common,
they can be the most physiologically and psychologically acute. They are usually associated
with public service career fields in which people experience intense stress levels because
of imminent danger and a high degree of uncertainty—police officer, fire and rescue worker,
emergency relief worker, and the military.

You may not plan to enter a high-stress career, but as a college student, you may find
that the demands of college life can create stressful situations. The National Institute of
Mental Health (NIMH) notes some of the more common stressors for college students:

• Increased academic demands 

• Being on your own in a new environment

• Changes in family relations

• Financial responsibilities

• Changes in your social life

• Exposure to new people, ideas, and temptations

• Awareness of your sexual identity and orientation

• Preparing for life after graduation
